2.	Description
a.	 What is it?
Delete Empty Folder is an application written in C# with the .NET framework. It generates a Windows Form to display a graphical interface the user can interact with. Given a file system path, the application accesses the pathâ€™s directories and its subdirectories to check if any folder or zip file needs to be deleted. Folders are deleted if they are empty. Zip files are deleted if they are empty. Also, the application checks the entries of each zip file. Delete Empty Folder deletes an entry in a zip file if the entry is empty or the entry contains only a header but no data.
b.	How to use it?
To use the Delete Empty Folder follow the steps below:
1.	Run the application
